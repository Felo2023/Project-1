# Project-1
Data source = https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/datos-abiertos-152127
Jupyter notebook "Main program4.0" is able to collect all data from the Data source files. However, only a random sample is used (1000) for the analysis.
Data such as ['NO APLICA','NO ESPECIFICADO','SE IGNORA','NO APLICA (CASO SIN MUESTRA)','RESULTADO NO ADECUADO '], is not considered in the statistical analysis.
The main objective of this analysis is to demonstrate the correlation between a variable (Diabetes, Sex, Age) and the death of a pacient.
